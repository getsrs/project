        <h3>PROJECT TITLE: EVENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IN JNTUH</h3>
        <p>
            “Event management in jntuh” presents the design and development of an advanced event management website specifically for Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Hyderabad (JNTUH). The system is engineered to streamline event organization and communication within the university community, with a focus on the following key features:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>User Profiles:</strong> Enabling students, faculty, and staff at JNTUH to create personalized profiles. These profiles empower users to manage event registrations, track event history, and customize preferences according to their individual interests and schedules.</li>
            <li><strong>Event Calendar:</strong> Offering a comprehensive calendar that showcases all upcoming events within JNTUH. This calendar encompasses a wide range of events including academic, extracurricular, and administrative activities. Users have the flexibility to filter events based on categories and subscribe to event notifications to stay informed about relevant happenings.</li>
            <li><strong>Event Registration and Ticketing:</strong> Facilitating seamless event registration and ticket purchasing directly through the website. The system supports both free and paid events, ensuring secure payment processing to enhance user convenience and satisfaction.</li>
            <li><strong>Event Creation and Management:</strong> Empowering authorized users within JNTUH to create and manage events efficiently. This feature encompasses various tools and functionalities such as setting event details (dates, times, locations, capacities, and registration deadlines), managing event logistics, communicating with attendees, managing RSVPs, and tracking attendance.</li>
            <li><strong>Mobile Optimization:</strong> Ensuring optimal accessibility and user experience by implementing full responsiveness and optimization for mobile devices. Given the prevalence of smartphones and tablets among the JNTUH community, providing a seamless mobile experience is paramount to enhance engagement and participation.</li>
        </ol>
